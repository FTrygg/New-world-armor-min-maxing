# What is this?

In contrast to some other games, the overall weight of armor in new world determines which weigtclass you are in.
So instead of only wearing light armor (or medium) a combination of different weightclasses on each armor piece yields better protection while still falling into the same weightclass.

# Why did I do this?
<ul>
<li>I was bored</li>
<li>I couldn't find an extensive explanation on what combination is best</li>
<li>I didn't trust the other recommendations</li>
<li>I already had an armorpiece I liked and wanted to see what the best combination with this piece in slot would be ;)</li>
</ul>


# TLDR:
The best combinations for the weightclasses are

## Light
| Rank | Total weight | Total protection | Helmet | Chest | Gloves | Pants | Boots |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 12.6 | 611.0 | Medium | Light | Light | Medium | Light |
| 2 | 12.6 | 611.0 | Light | Light | Medium | Medium | Light |
| 3 | 12.6 | 611.0 | Light | Light | Light | Medium | Medium |

## Medium
| Rank | Total weight | Total protection | Helmet | Chest | Gloves | Pants | Boots |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | 22.9 | 611.0 | Medium | Heavy | Medium | Light | Heavy |
| 2 | 22.9 | 611.0 | Medium | Heavy | Heavy | Light | Medium |
| 3 | 22.9 | 611.0 | Heavy | Heavy | Medium | Light | Medium |

## Heavy
Uhm wear all heavy?

# How did you get these numbers?
Find the quick and dirty code [here](/minmax.py). You can also modify the protection values to your liking, in case this is outdated at some point.
For my calculations, the faction gear was used.
